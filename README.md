# Basic-machine-learning
## Project based to make a comparison between marchine learning method, using Linear and Polynomial (from 2 until 4) Regression

### Data source
webiste - https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/xlsx/energy-economics/statistical-review/bp-stats-review-2019-all-data.xlsx

The steps are:

0. Import the libraries
1. Import the data from the BP statistical review on the tab for Carbon Emission, using data cleaning for the columns and rows that has only NaN values (with the help os seaborn heatmap on the visual side)
2. Make the Linear Regression
3. Make the Polynomial Regression from the degree 2, 3 and 4.
